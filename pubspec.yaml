description: A `Scaffold`-like widget tailored for tab-bar navigation. When creating a [Scaffold]
  that uses a [BottomNavigationBar], it's not uncommon to end up with lengthy, unreadable code;
  this package provides a `TabbedScaffold` widget that aims to reduce the complexity of creating
  a tab-bar navigation.
